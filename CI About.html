                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>
                    Pan African Community Services is a 501(C)(3) pending organization that is registered in Seattle
                    with an operational scope that spans King County in Seattle, Washington. As a nonprofit serving
                    families and young people of African origin in King County, we offer referral services and culturally
                    sensitive activities that aid in their social integration.
                    PACS was founded in 2020 by a group of African individuals motivated by the desire to unite
                    underprivileged minority communities in Washington through various programs and services
                    designed to eliminate disparities and inequality among African-descendant individuals and families.
                    PACS aims to be recognized as a leader in improving quality-of-life outcomes for African immigrant
                    and refugee families in King County.
